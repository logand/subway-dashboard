# subway-dashboard

Welcome to the NYC Subway Dashboard App.
The purpose of this application is to display your local subway train times along with actionable weather data eg. Do I need an Umbrella? Do I need a jacket?

This app was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
The JSON data it consumes for the subway information comes from [MTAPI](https://github.com/jonthornton/MTAPI)
I am using [weather icons](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons) to display the current weather from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 on your local development machine.
In order to get started clone the repo and then run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
